# Snake JS

Snake JS is a classic snake game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an engaging gameplay experience where players control a snake and try to eat as much food as possible while avoiding collisions with walls and their own body. The game features customizable themes, different difficulty levels, and audio control.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to guide the snake to eat food and grow longer. The player controls the snake's movement using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right). As the snake consumes food, it increases in length. The game becomes more challenging as the snake grows, making it harder to avoid collisions. The game ends if the snake hits a wall or collides with its own body.
